## General Information
This is an attempt to do Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on the customer loan dataset to derive insights related to what factors contribute to loan defaulting by consumers.

This analysis would help the bank to make better decisions in giving loans to customers.

The following steps are taken while doing the analysis:
1. Data cleaning:
    - Dropping columns with more than 75% missing values.
    - Modified column data types.
2. Univariate Analysis
3. Segmented Analysis
4. Bivariate Analysis
5. Deriving new columns like principal amount.

## Conclusions
1. Customers with higher loan time period have a higher tendency to default their loans.
2. Customers with high principal amount are more likely to default their loans.
3. Customers having an annual income less than â‚¹75000 are more likely to default their loans.
4. Customers living on rent or mortgage have a 50% rate of loan defaulting among the total defaulters.

## Technologies Used
